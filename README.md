# spaCy-Transformer-NER
This project demonstrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy 3 and transformers in Google Colab. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training with a custom config, evaluation, and prediction visualization. The model is trained on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and evaluated using common NER metrics.
